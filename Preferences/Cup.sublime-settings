        #### Description

        if it is a string like 'some/directory' then `-o some/directory` will be added to `coffee` compiler.
        if it is false or not string then it will compile your `script.coffee` to the directory it is in.

        #### Example:
        Directory is relative to the file you are editing if specified such as
            compileDir": "out"
        Directory is absolute if specified such as
            compileDir": "/home/logan/Desktop/out"

    */

        ## Enable compiling to a specific relative directories.

        #### Example:
        Set absolute path for compile dir:
            "compileDir": "/home/user/projects/js"
        And specified folders
            "relativeDir": "/home/user/projects/coffee"

                "/home/user/projects/second/coffee": "../js",
            }

        So
            "/home/user/projects/coffee/app.coffee" will compile to "/home/user/projects/first/js/app.js"
            "/home/user/projects/coffee/models/prod.coffee" will compile to "/home/user/projects/first/js/models/prod.js"
            "/home/user/projects/coffee/second/coffee/app2.coffee" will compile to "/home/user/projects/second/js/app2.js"
            "/home/user/projects/main.coffee" will compile to "/home/user/projects/js/main.js"
